# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation
> practice projects utilizing abstraction and encapsulation.

>I created this Python program because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I wrote this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming.

Project Description
This reporsitory is composed of 3 project utilizing abstraction and encapsulation. This projects include sub-project of car, pet and fan attributes.

## How to Use?
>To use this program:
>1. The user will need to download the files.

>2. Once downloaded, open the file with any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.

>3. Since there is 3 sub-project in this reporsitory, you can run TestFan, PetObject and CarObject one at a time.

>4. The CarTest won't be needing any input from user so the program will automatically run.

>5. The PetObject and CarObject will be asking users for input, type your inputs in the console.



## Heres a sample video of the program:
